# coffeeMisc

Firstly I must say this project would not be possible without the incredible program written by J Gagne at coffeeadastra.com.
Many parts have been taken directly from his source code which can be found at:
https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize

My code here simply takes data collected by his coffee grind size app and puts it into a readable form for multiple grind settings.
Statistics is not something I'm incredibly familiar with, so if I have misrepresented any data here please let me know.


This is a project I undertook at our coffee lab to quantify if the tastes we experienced on our Mahlkonig EK-43 were due to misaligned burrs.
Upon initial inspection the burrs were misaligned slightly both axially and radially. After shimming and aligning the faceplate-side burrs there was a noticeable improvement in grind passthrough time (less time for residuals to exit the grinding chamber) as well as a qualitative improvement in flavor, especially brew-to-brew at our typical grind setting.
Re-taking data post-alignment shows improvements in both grind quality and grind-setting change linearity. However upon opening up the grinder the burrs did appear and feel quite dull and should likely be replaced in the near future.
