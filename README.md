# coffeeMisc

Firstly I must say this project would not be possible without the incredible program written by J Gagne at coffeeadastra.com.
Many parts have been taken directly from his source code which can be found at:
https://github.com/jgagneastro/coffeegrindsize

My code here simply takes data collected by his coffee grind size app and puts it into a readable form for multiple grind settings.
Statistics is not something I'm incredibly familiar with, so if I have misrepresented any data here please let me know.


This is a project I undertook at our coffee lab to quantify whether the tastes we experienced on our EK-43 were due to misaligned burrs. 
After shimming the burrs a qualitative improvement could be detected in flavor, especially brew-to-brew. The results of re-taking data
shows improvements in both grind quality and grind-setting change linearity.
